Description: Quantile regression with fixed effects is a general model for longitudinal data. Here we proposed to solve it by several methods. The estimation methods include three loss functions as check, asymmetric least square and asymmetric Huber functions; and three structures as simple regression, fixed effects and fixed effects with penalized intercepts by LASSO.
